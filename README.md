# ArabicMsForms

A cross-browser extension to change the display language of Microsoft Forms to Arabic!

# Installation

Now this can be installed manually in both [Google Chrome](https://medium.com/@FGrante/how-to-install-a-chrome-extension-without-using-the-chrome-web-store-31902c780034) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.ghacks.net/2015/04/19/how-to-install-firefox-add-ons-directly-on-github/).

**Soon** this extension will be avilable in both [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) stores.

# Usage
After the installation, the extension will automatically add ```lang=ar``` to the proper Microsoft Forms' URLs.

To disable the extension from working for a certain time, just press its icon (the icon will appear in black & white).

# FAQ

## Why this exists?

My school tests are usually written in Arabic (RTL language) while I prefer to set my browser language preference to English (which affects the questions' readability), but unfortunately, Microsoft Forms doesn't have a drop-down menu or something like that to change the interface language, instead of that I should change the browser language preference to change the Microsoft Forms interface language!!!

After searching for a while I found [this official page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/language-settings-for-microsoft-forms-b282f9aa-0fe4-4290-b1e1-827a8a35ac27) says that I can change the interface language by adding a query param to the URL which is ```lang=ar``` (in my case), so I created this extension to do that for me automatically.

## Why you didn't create a popup panel to choose any language instead of hardcoding the Arabic?

That's why this is open source ðŸ˜‰.
