# FAQ

## Why this exists?

My school tests are usually written in Arabic (RTL language) while I prefer to set my browser language preference to English (which affects the questions' readability), but unfortunately, Microsoft Forms doesn't have a drop-down menu or something like that to change the interface language, instead of that I should change the browser language preference to change the Microsoft Forms interface language!!!

After searching for a while I found [this official page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/language-settings-for-microsoft-forms-b282f9aa-0fe4-4290-b1e1-827a8a35ac27) says that I can change the interface language by adding a query param to the URL which is ```lang=ar``` (in my case), so I created this extension to do that for me automatically.

## Why you didn't create a popup panel to choose any language instead of hardcoding the Arabic?

That's why this is open source ðŸ˜‰.
