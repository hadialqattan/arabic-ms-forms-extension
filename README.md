## Installation

- [Google Chrome Extensions WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arabicmsforms/ojkgdfdcnecnkndghddcpmdbbdedeocd)
- [Mozilla Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arabicmsforms/)
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/arabicmsforms/anfogchmdlmfclgijpaljcnaceiameej)

## Usage

After the installation, the extension will automatically add `lang=ar` to the proper Microsoft Forms' URLs.

To disable the extension from working for a certain amount of time, you only need to press its icon (the icon will appear in black & white), same for re-enabling.

## FAQ

### Why this exists?

My school tests are usually written in Arabic (RTL language) while I prefer to set my browser's language to English (which cause readability issues) while Microsoft Forms doesn't have an easy way to change its language, instead, I have to change the browser's language to change Microsoft Forms language!!!

After searching for a while I found [this official page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/language-settings-for-microsoft-forms-b282f9aa-0fe4-4290-b1e1-827a8a35ac27) says that I can change the interface language by adding a query param to the URL which is `lang=ar` (in my case), so I've created this extension to do that automatically.

### Why you didn't create a popup panel to choose any language instead of hardcoding the Arabic?

That's why this is open source ðŸ˜‰.
